# Contributing

This is a small personal project. If you spot a rough edge, feel free to open an issue with a clear description. Pull requests are welcome but might sit for a bit.

Guidelines:
- Keep changes focused and small
- Stick to the standard library
- Prefer straightforward code over cleverness
